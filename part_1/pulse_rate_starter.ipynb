    "        This algorithm calculates an estimated pulse rate from raw photoplethysmogram(PPG) data in the presence of noise motion in the x,y,            and z axis from an accelerometer. The PPG and accelerometer data used with this algorithm was from the Troika dataset, and consists            of PPG and accelerometer data from 12 subjects wearing a wrist device while walking, running and during a brief cooldown on a                  treadmill. The reference labels for the data represents the subjects' pulse rate in beats per minute(bpm) and was calculated in eight          second windows, incremented every 2 seconds. The algorithm attempts to mimic this calculation, by first bandpass filtering the PPG and\n",
    "        aggregated accelerometer signals, and then calculating the estimated pulse rate by computing the fast fourier transform(fft) for the           filtered PPG and accelerometer signals. After which, the frequency where the highest magnitude PPG signal exists is determined. This           frequency is multiplied by 60 seconds to obtain the estimated pulse rate. Next the estimated confidence that the frequency used to             determine the estimated pulse rate is calculated. This is done by dividing the spectral energy at that frequency by the total spectral         energy in the spectrum. The above process is performed in eight second windows on the PPG signal data, these                                   windows are incremented every 2 seconds. The algorithm also calculates the mean absolute error for each pulse rate estimate by                 first interpolating the estimated pulse rate to the reference label and then computing the mean absolute error between this                    interpolated pulse rate and the reference pulse rate. The algorithm returns a tuple of two numpy arrays, one numpy array is for                the mean absolute errors and the other is for the confidence estimates.\n",

    "The algorithm is designed to calculate an estimated pulse rate from data collected from a photoplethysmogram(PPG) device, return an error between the estimated pulse rate and a reference pulse rate as well as a confidence regarding the estimated pulse rate. The algorithm can be run inside a python script or a jupyter notebook code block. It can be run by invoking the RunPulseRateAlgorithm function and supplying a data file and ref file from the Troika dataset.\n",

    "The raw PPG and accelerometer data was stored in .mat files,  and consists of PPG and accelerometer data in the x,y and z axis from 12 subjects wearing a wrist device while walking, running and during a brief cooldown on a treadmill. The reference labels for the data represents the subjects' pulse rate in beats per minute(bpm)and was calculated in eight second windows, incremented every 2 seconds. The period from oscillating PPG generated by the PPG sensor and the signals generated by the accelerometer were used by the algorithm to estimate pulse rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the shortcomings of the dataset could be the small number of subjects, at 12, yielding only 12 sets of PPG signals and labels, the absence of pulse rates taken from the subjects at rest without any motion, and the lack of any other general information on the subjects such as age and gender. \n",

    "#### How the algorithm works\n",
    "In the main RunPulseRateAlgorithm function, first the data file containing the PPG and accelerometer data along with the file contained the reference pulse rates are loade. Then the PPG and aggregated accelerometer signals are bandpass filtered using the band_pass_filter function. These filtered signals are inputted, reference pulse rate and the sampling rate are inputted to the moving_pulse_confidence_estimate function. In the moving_pulse_confidence_estimate function the estimated pulse rate and confidence is calculated in eight second windows on the PPG signal data, these windows are incremented every 2 seconds. The estimated pulse rate and confidence is calculated in the pulse_confidence_calc function by computing the fast fourier transform(fft) for the filtered PPG and accelerometer signals. After which, the frequency where the highest magnitude PPG signal exists is determined. This frequency is multiplied by 60 seconds to obtain the estimated pulse rate. Next the estimated confidence that the frequency used to determine the estimated pulse rate is calculated. This is done by dividing the spectral energy at that frequency by the total spectral energy in the spectrum. In the calc_errs function which is called in the moving_pulse_confidence_estimate function, the algorithm calculates the mean absolute error for each pulse rate estimate by first interpolating the estimated pulse rate to the reference label and then computing the mean absolute error between this interpolated pulse rate and the reference pulse rate. The algorithm returns a tuple of two numpy arrays, one numpy array is for the mean absolute errors and the other is for the confidence estimates in the RunPulseRateAlgorithm function.\n",
